    <p>
      Learning to code has been something that I’ve always wanted to achieve. I remember learning CSS in middle school – which now seems like forever ago. I did not take it seriously and used this class to goof around (well, mainly because I was a silly teen),
      but I remember being intrigued by the code behind the program. And, for the age and time, I felt like I understood the language more than my peers. <br /><br /> As I an adult I knew that I wanted something unique and interesting for me and
      something where I can support my family at the same time. I remember looking back and reflecting on how much I loved to code and design. I began to look into online tutorials then came upon Austin’s finest coding school – Austin Coding Academy.
      I am looking forward to learn code, understand best practices and create the best responsive emails for my company.
